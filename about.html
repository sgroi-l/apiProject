    <p>Welcome to WeatherWise, the app that keeps you informed about the current weather conditions in any city around the world while providing fun activity suggestions based on the weather. Developed by Laurie Sgroi and Georgina Appeagyei, WeatherWise aims to make your daily plans more enjoyable and weather-conscious.</p>
    
    <h2>Discover the Weather, Explore the World</h2>
   
    <p>WeatherWise utilizes the powerful OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data from various locations worldwide. Simply enter the name of a city, and WeatherWise will retrieve the current weather information for you. Stay informed about the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, all at your fingertips.</p>
    
    <h2>Weather-Inspired Activities</h2>
   
    <p>But WeatherWise doesn't stop at just giving you weather updates. We believe that knowing the weather opens up exciting possibilities for activities that perfectly complement the conditions outside. Our app intelligently suggests activities based on the current weather in your selected city, thanks to the integration of the Bored API. Whether it's a sunny day, a snowy evening, or a rainy afternoon, WeatherWise has the ideal activity recommendation just for you.</p>

    <h2>Keep Track of Your Searches</h2>

    <p>At WeatherWise, we understand the importance of personalization and keeping a record of your past searches.
